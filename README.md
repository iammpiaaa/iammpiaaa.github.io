## Ranking Harry Potter books (least to most favorite)
Owned by Mary Noelle Pauline I. Antonio

May I remind that these are my opinions only and I love all the Harry Potter books. And SPOILER ALERT if you haven't read it.



**7.Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets**

>This book just gives me a lot of suspense. Like who opened the Chamber of Secrets, what is the monster roaming around Hogwarts, the voice, the message on the wall and who is Tom Riddle, the man who owns the diary. This book really makes me eager and excited to read it. And I feel terrible for ranking this book last.

**6. Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone**

>This book is special as this is where all it started. We get to see Harry find out he is a wizard and go to his first Hogwarts journey. It is simple and child-friendly. This book is truly magical and it just makes me really happy. I feel bad for putting this on sixth, as I enjoyed the action and plot more in the other books, but this book is wonderful. 

**5.  Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix**

>Firstly, I had a lot of favorite scenes in this book. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, Harry and Dumbledore’s confrontation in Dumbledore’s office are some of my favorite moments. Other scenes that I liked are Luna's and Harry's talk near the end of the book, the trio seeing Neville at St. Mungo's, and Snape's Worst Memory. This book is the longest but I liked how detailed this book is.

**4. Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows**

>I really like the adventures and the detective work shown in the story. Instead of going to their last year in Hogwarts, the trio went to adventures to search for the horcruxes. I like the adventures they do because we get to see the trio using their skills to survive in their horcrux hunt. There is a lot of emotional scenes in this book which made me cry. Like the part where Harry is in the Forbidden Forest walking to face Voldemort.

**3. Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban**

>What I like about this book is the story behind the Marauders. I really find it intriguing to read and I just really like the Marauders story. I felt the excitement reading the part where Sirius is revealed. Dementors are introduced, and so is the Patronus Charm, which is my favorite charms in the entire series.

**2. Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire**

>As to why this is my second favorite is because this book was fun to read. The Tri-Wizard Tournament is an enjoyable event to read about. The different challenges Harry had to face are unique and entertaining. I like how this book expands the wizarding world. Introducing the Quidditch World Cup, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons. And one of the best part in this book is when we meet Voldemort. Reading it was quite thrilling

**1. Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince**

>This book is my favorite from the series. What I love about this book is the mysteries it presented. We see the bond between Dumbledore and Harry when Dumbledore gives Harry private lesson to understand more of Voldemort's life. On how he slowly turns evil and desprate for power. And how in many ways we see his character is parallel to Harry. We also get to see the change in Draco's character. Which is really interesting as Draco's been introduced since the first book. Before, we only see him as Harry's bully, but here we see the pressure he is going through. The mystery of the Half Blood Price is really intriguing. And here, it really made me wonder where Snape's true allegiance lie.


So that was my ranking of the Harry Potter books. And again I love all of them and this was just for fun!
